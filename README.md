# SpaceX_Launch_Analysis_Project
🚀 SpaceX Launch Analysis Project
This repository showcases a comprehensive data science workflow applied to SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data. It combines geospatial mapping, predictive modeling, and interactive dashboard visualization to explore launch site characteristics and predict landing success.

📂 Project Structure
1_geospatial_mapping.ipynb Folium-based interactive maps analyzing launch site locations, proximity to railways, highways, coastlines, and cities.

2_classification_models.ipynb Predictive modeling using Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Decision Tree to classify landing outcomes.

3_dashboard_visualization.py Dash-powered dashboard displaying launch success metrics, model performance, and geospatial overlays.

assets/ Contains images, captions, and visual outputs used in documentation and peer review slides.

slides/ Peer-ready presentation summarizing workflow, insights, and model comparisons.
